jellobot is a a plugable irc bot written for node.js.

Primary features:

- makes it easy to write plugins and configure them from one config file
- code is live refreshed for zero-downtime updates, which also makes development much
  faster

Default plugins:

- repaste: repastes various paste services to gist.github.com and formats js code
- rng: picks a random item from a list
- js-eval: runs js code in a docker sandbox, and prints out the result

## Setup

To full run the bot, you'll need node.js (10.x recommended), docker (with your user
having permission to execute containers), and libmagic.

```sh
# Install libmagic and icu4c on OSX
brew install libmagic icu4c
```

Then to get the dependencies run `npm install`.

Then create a config file...
